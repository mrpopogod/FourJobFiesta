FourJobFiesta
=============

Small utility for doing a non-weighted random Four Job Fiesta party

I was dissatisfied with how the existing random mode weighs things towards the wind jobs.  With this it will generate four random jobs, then for the wind crystal it randomly picks a wind job from your four (if no wind job, then a water job, if no water, then a fire, etc).  If there were two wind jobs then your second wind job might be assigned at any of the other crystals.  This means you potentially stay as freelancers longer, but that has its own interesting quirks.
